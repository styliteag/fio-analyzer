# Research: Vue.js Frontend Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
Research findings for rebuilding the FIO Analyzer frontend dashboard using Vue.js 3.4+ with TypeScript, focusing on performance visualization and filtering systems.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: Vue.js 3.4+ with Composition API and TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Existing codebase already uses Vue.js 3.4
- Composition API provides better TypeScript support and component reusability
- Mature ecosystem with excellent tooling (Vite, Vue DevTools)
- Performance optimizations for large dataset rendering
**Alternatives considered**: React (rejected due to existing Vue.js investment), Svelte (rejected due to smaller ecosystem)

### State Management
**Decision**: Pinia 2.1 for centralized state management
**Rationale**:
- Official Vue.js state management library
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Simple API compared to Vuex
- Built-in DevTools support
**Alternatives considered**: Vuex (rejected - deprecated), Zustand (rejected - React-focused)

### Styling Framework
**Decision**: TailwindCSS 3.4 with custom component classes
**Rationale**:
- Already present in existing codebase
- Utility-first approach enables rapid UI development
- Excellent dark theme support (required for login page)
- Built-in responsive design utilities
**Alternatives considered**: CSS Modules (rejected - more verbose), styled-components (rejected - not Vue-native)

### Data Visualization
**Decision**: Chart.js 4.4 with Vue-ChartJs 5.3 wrapper
**Rationale**:
- Already present in dependencies
- Comprehensive chart types (scatter plots, heatmaps, line charts)
- Good performance with large datasets (1000+ points)
- Extensive customization options for performance zones
**Alternatives considered**: D3.js (rejected - too complex for requirements), ECharts (rejected - larger bundle size)

### Icon System
**Decision**: Lucide Vue Next for consistent iconography
**Rationale**:
- Already present in dependencies
- Comprehensive icon set including performance/analytics icons
- Vue 3 optimized components
- Small bundle size impact
**Alternatives considered**: Vue Heroicons (rejected - limited selection), Font Awesome (rejected - larger bundle)

### Testing Framework
**Decision**: Vitest 3.2+ with Vue Test Utils 2.4+ and JSdom
**Rationale**:
- Native Vite integration (faster than Jest)
- Excellent Vue.js component testing support
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Compatible with existing setup
**Alternatives considered**: Jest (rejected - slower with Vite), Cypress (complementary for E2E, not replacement)

## API Integration Patterns

### Data Fetching Strategy
**Decision**: Composable-based API client with reactive error handling
**Rationale**:
- Vue.js Composition API enables reusable data fetching logic
- Centralized error handling for all API endpoints
- Reactive state updates for UI components
- Supports requirement FR-022C (error display + console logging)

### Endpoint Usage Constraints
**Decision**: Exclusive use of `/api/test-runs/` and `/api/filters` endpoints
**Rationale**:
- Per specification requirement FR-022B
- `/api/time-series` excluded from current implementation scope
- All chart data must be computed client-side from test runs data
- Reduces backend dependency and increases frontend processing

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Large Dataset Handling
**Decision**: Client-side data processing with browser optimization reliance
**Rationale**:
- Per clarification: "Load all data and rely on browser rendering optimization"
- Chart.js provides efficient canvas rendering for 1000+ data points
- Vue.js reactivity system optimized for large arrays
- Browser engines handle DOM updates efficiently for modern datasets

### Filter Logic Implementation
**Decision**: OR logic within categories, AND logic between categories
**Rationale**:
- Per clarification: "OR logic within category"
- Standard filtering UX pattern
- Enables intuitive multi-selection behavior
- Supports complex filter combinations

### Heatmap Color Scaling
**Decision**: Relative color scaling normalized to current filtered dataset
**Rationale**:
- Per clarification: "Relative scale normalized to current filtered dataset's min/max values"
- Provides better visual contrast within filtered data
- Adapts dynamically to filter changes
- More meaningful color differentiation

## Component Architecture

### Component Structure
**Decision**: Atomic design methodology with composables for business logic
**Rationale**:
- Atoms: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards)
- Molecules: Filter components, metric cards, chart containers
- Organisms: Dashboard sections, visualization panels
- Templates: Page layouts with routing
- Composables: API integration, state management, data processing

### State Persistence Strategy
**Decision**: localStorage for host selections and user preferences
**Rationale**:
- Per requirement: host selections persist "across all pages until explicitly cleared or logout"
- Browser localStorage provides persistent cross-session storage
- JSON serialization for complex filter states
- Clear separation between session and persistent data

## Error Handling Approach

### User Experience
**Decision**: Toast notifications for API errors with fallback to inline messages
**Rationale**:
- Per requirement FR-022C: "display API endpoint errors to users in browser interface"
- Non-blocking notifications for better UX
- Contextual error messages near relevant components
- Progressive disclosure for error details

### Developer Experience
**Decision**: Structured console logging with request/response details
**Rationale**:
- Per requirement FR-022C: "log detailed error information to browser console"
- Include HTTP status codes, request URLs, response bodies
- Timestamp and correlation ID tracking
- Development vs production logging levels

## Accessibility Considerations

### WCAG Compliance
**Decision**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with focus management
**Rationale**:
- Color-blind friendly visualization palettes
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatible component labels
- Sufficient color contrast ratios (especially for dark theme)

### Performance Metrics
**Decision**: Core Web Vitals monitoring with performance budgets
**Rationale**:
- Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s for dashboard loading
- First Input Delay < 100ms for filter interactions
- Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1 for visualization stability
- Bundle size budget: <500KB gzipped

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Integration
**Decision**: HTTP Basic Auth with secure session management
**Rationale**:
- Integrates with existing FastAPI backend authentication
- Role-based access control (admin vs uploader)
- Secure logout with session cleanup
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations

### Data Validation
**Decision**: Client-side validation with server-side verification
**Rationale**:
- TypeScript interfaces for API response validation
- Runtime type checking for critical data structures
- Graceful degradation for malformed responses
- Input sanitization for user-entered filter values

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Authentication system and routing
2. Basic layout with navigation
3. API client with error handling
4. State management setup

### Phase 2: Data Display
1. Statistics cards with real data
2. Basic filtering system
3. Simple table/list views
4. Empty state handling

### Phase 3: Visualizations
1. Performance heatmap with relative scaling
2. Basic charts (IOPS, latency, bandwidth)
3. Scatter plot with performance zones
4. Interactive chart features

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Multi-host selection with persistence
2. Advanced filtering options
3. Additional visualization modes
4. User management interface

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Large dataset performance**: Mitigated by Chart.js optimization and progressive loading

- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Mitigated by modern browser targeting and testing

### Medium Risk Items
- **API error handling complexity**: Mitigated by centralized error handling patterns
- **Color accessibility in visualizations**: Mitigated by accessible color palette selection

### Low Risk Items
- **Component reusability**: Vue.js composition API provides good patterns
- **State management complexity**: Pinia provides simple, scalable state management
