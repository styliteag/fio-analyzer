# Feature Specification: Rebuild Vue.js Frontend Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `005-i-have-clear`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i have clear all things from the frontend, we have to write the rest of the frontend in ./frontend-vue now from scratch. It is currently only able to login. I will provide screenshots how i think the new frontend should look. You have to look at the backend api and figure out what to do with the data in the backend (with the screenshots). Focus at /api/test-runs/ and how it works with /api/filters  DONT use the /api/time-series we will do that later."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a storage administrator, I need a comprehensive web dashboard that allows me to view, filter, and analyze FIO performance test results from multiple servers and storage configurations through a modern, intuitive interface with statistical cards, interactive charts, and detailed performance analysis views, so I can make informed decisions about storage infrastructure performance and optimization.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the application, **When** they are not authenticated, **Then** they should see a modern dark-themed login page with "Sign in to FIO Analyzer" branding
2. **Given** a user is authenticated as admin, **When** they access the main dashboard, **Then** they should see a welcome message, navigation bar with Light/Upload/Admin/Users/FIO Benchmark Analysis options, and performance statistics cards
3. **Given** the dashboard loads, **When** displaying overview statistics, **Then** it should show cards for Total Test Runs, Active Servers, Avg IOPS, Avg Latency, Last Upload time, and Total Hostnames with History counts
4. **Given** the dashboard displays data, **When** showing recent activity, **Then** it should list recent test uploads and server performance analysis with timestamps
5. **Given** the dashboard shows system status, **When** displaying health information, **Then** it should show Backend API, Database, File Storage, and Authentication status with colored indicators
6. **Given** a user clicks navigation tabs, **When** selecting different analysis modes, **Then** they should see options for Performance Analytics, Test History, Advanced Host Comparison, and Host Analysis
7. **Given** a user accesses host analysis, **When** selecting multiple hosts, **Then** they should see a tag-based host selector with removable host tags and comprehensive filtering sidebar
8. **Given** filters are available, **When** user wants to narrow results, **Then** they should see filter options for Block Sizes, Read/Write Patterns, Queue Depths, Number of Jobs, Protocols, and Host-Protocol-Disk combinations
9. **Given** performance data is displayed, **When** viewing analysis results, **Then** they should see multiple visualization options including Performance Heatmap, Performance Graphs, Radar Comparison, IOPS vs Latency scatter plots, and Parallel Coordinates
10. **Given** user selects visualization modes, **When** viewing heatmaps, **Then** they should see color-coded performance metrics across different configurations with detailed tooltips and legends

### Edge Cases
- **No test data**: Display "No test data available" message in dashboard cards, show empty charts with "No data to display" placeholder, disable filter controls
- **API connection failures**: Show "Connection Error" status in System Status panel, display "Unable to load data" message in affected components, log detailed error to console
- **Zero filter results**: Display "No results match your filters" message, show "Try adjusting your filters" suggestion, maintain filter state for user adjustment
- **Large datasets (1000+ test runs)**: Implement virtual scrolling for tables, use data sampling for initial chart rendering, provide "Load more" pagination controls
- **No hosts selected**: Show "Select at least one host to view analysis" message, disable visualization tabs, highlight host selector with warning border
- **API errors**: 
  - 401 Unauthorized: Redirect to login page with "Session expired" message
  - 403 Forbidden: Show "Access denied" message with "Contact administrator" suggestion
  - 500 Internal Server Error: Show "Server error occurred" message with "Try again later" suggestion
- **Malformed API responses**: Display "Data format error" message, log raw response to console, fall back to cached data if available

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: When a user selects multiple items within a single filter category (e.g., both "4K" and "64K" block sizes), should the system show results matching ANY of the selected values (OR logic within category), ALL of the selected values (AND logic within category), or allow user to toggle between OR/AND modes per category? → A: Show results matching ANY of the selected values (OR logic within category)
- Q: For the Performance Heatmap's color-coded cells, how should the color scale be determined? → A: Relative scale normalized to the current filtered dataset's min/max values
- Q: When a user selects multiple hosts in the host analysis view, how should these selections persist? → A: Persist selections across all pages until explicitly cleared or logout
- Q: When displaying visualizations with large datasets (1000+ test runs), how should the system optimize performance? → A: Load all data and rely on browser rendering optimization
- Q: When no test data exists or filters return zero results, what should the dashboard display? → A: Show empty charts/tables with "No data available" messages
- Q: Performance Graphs should not use /api/time-series endpoint - confirmed exclusion from current implementation scope → A: Confirmed - use only /api/test-runs and /api/filters endpoints
- Q: Should API endpoint errors be displayed to users in the browser interface or logged to browser console? → A: Show errors in browser interface and log to console
