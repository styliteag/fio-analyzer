# Research: Vue Frontend Migration

## Research Findings

### Vue 3 Migration Best Practices

**Decision**: Use Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- Better TypeScript integration than Options API
- More similar to React hooks (easier migration)
- Better tree-shaking and performance
- Future-proof approach aligned with Vue.js roadmap

**Alternatives considered**:
- Options API: Less TypeScript-friendly, harder to migrate from React patterns
- Vue 2: End of life, lacks modern features

### Chart Library Migration Strategy

**Decision**: Use vue-chartjs wrapper for Chart.js + Three.js for 3D charts
**Rationale**:
- vue-chartjs provides Vue 3 bindings for Chart.js
- Maintains same chart capabilities as React frontend
- Three.js works independently of framework
- Minimal learning curve for existing Chart.js configurations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Native Vue chart libraries: Would require rewriting all chart configurations
- D3.js direct integration: Too complex for migration timeline

### Component Architecture Migration

**Decision**: Mirror React component structure in Vue equivalents
**Rationale**:
- Easier developer transition
- Maintains same mental model
- Faster migration with lower error risk
- Preserves existing component organization

**Alternatives considered**:
- Complete reorganization: Too risky for migration phase
- Monolithic components: Against Vue best practices

### State Management Approach

**Decision**: Use Vue 3 reactive refs and provide/inject for global state
**Rationale**:
- Simpler than adding Pinia/Vuex for migration
- Sufficient for current application complexity
- Native Vue 3 reactivity system handles most needs
- Easier to understand for React developers

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pinia: Overkill for current state complexity
- Vuex: Legacy approach, not recommended for Vue 3

### Authentication Implementation

**Decision**: Migrate existing authentication service pattern to Vue composables
**Rationale**:
- Composables are Vue's equivalent to React hooks
- Maintains same API integration approach
- Preserves existing backend authentication contracts
- Natural Vue 3 pattern for shared logic

**Alternatives considered**:
- Plugin-based auth: More complex integration
- Direct component integration: Not reusable

### Styling Migration Strategy

**Decision**: Preserve existing TailwindCSS classes and component styling
**Rationale**:
- Visual consistency during migration
- Faster development (copy existing styles)
- No design rework required
- TailwindCSS works identically in Vue

**Alternatives considered**:
- Vue-specific CSS solutions: Would require complete restyling
- CSS Modules: Different from current approach

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Focus on linting and TypeScript checking for migration phase
**Rationale**:
- Migration preserves existing functionality
- Backend API contracts provide integration testing
- Unit tests would duplicate React frontend tests
- Faster migration with same quality assurance

**Alternatives considered**:
- Full unit test suite: Time-consuming for migration
- E2E tests: Valuable but can be added post-migration

### Performance Optimization Approaches

**Decision**: Use Vue 3 built-in optimizations (reactive refs, computed properties, v-memo)
**Rationale**:
- Native Vue optimizations sufficient for current needs
- Similar performance characteristics to React optimizations
- No additional dependencies required
- Aligns with Vue ecosystem best practices

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual optimization: Premature for migration phase
- Third-party performance libraries: Added complexity

## Technology Stack Summary

- **Frontend Framework**: Vue 3 with Composition API
- **Type System**: TypeScript (preserved from React)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (preserved from React)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS (preserved from React)
- **Charts**: vue-chartjs + Chart.js + Three.js
- **State Management**: Vue 3 reactivity + composables
- **HTTP Client**: Fetch API or axios (same as React)
- **Development Tools**: Vue DevTools, ESLint, TypeScript compiler

## Migration Risk Mitigation

1. **Component Isolation**: Migrate one component at a time
2. **API Preservation**: No backend changes required
3. **Visual Parity**: Copy existing styles and layouts
4. **Functionality Testing**: Manual testing against React version
5. **Rollback Plan**: Keep React version until Vue is fully validated
