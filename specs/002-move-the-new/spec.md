# Feature Specification: Vue Frontend Migration to Functional Phase

**Feature Branch**: `002-move-the-new`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Move the new frontend in ./frontend-vue from the scafolding phase to a more functional phase copying most of the functional things form the old frontend (usability, css, layout and other things)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature identified: Migrate Vue frontend from scaffolding to functional state
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: developers, end users
   � Actions: copy features, maintain usability, preserve layout
   � Data: performance metrics, test runs, charts
   � Constraints: maintain feature parity with React frontend
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific React components should be prioritized first?]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should authentication flow be migrated as-is or redesigned?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flow: Access same functionality through Vue interface as React
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement focuses on feature parity and usability
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Test runs, performance metrics, charts, user sessions
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties about migration priorities"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: What should happen during the transition period when both React and Vue frontends exist? → A: Replace React completely - deploy Vue as the single frontend
- Q: Which React components should be migrated first to establish the foundation? → A: Authentication & navigation - core user access components
- Q: How should performance be measured to validate "comparable to React version"? → A: User interaction responsiveness - click-to-render delays
- Q: What constitutes "identical functionality" for chart interactions? → A: Same general features, appearance may differ
- Q: What level of data validation should be maintained during migration? → A: Minimal validation - rely on backend API validation

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a storage performance analyst, I need the Vue frontend to provide the same functionality as the existing React frontend so that I can seamlessly transition to the new interface without losing any capabilities for analyzing FIO benchmark results.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the Vue frontend is deployed, **When** a user navigates to the application, **Then** they see the same layout, navigation, and visual design as the React version
2. **Given** a user has performance data, **When** they access charts and visualizations, **Then** all chart types (radar, line, 3D bar) display the same data with equivalent functionality
3. **Given** a user needs to filter data, **When** they use filter controls, **Then** the filtering behavior matches the React frontend exactly
4. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they access admin features, **Then** user management and administrative functions work identically to the React version
5. **Given** a user wants to export data, **When** they use export functions, **Then** the same export formats and options are available

### Edge Cases
- What happens when migrated components have different Vue-specific behaviors compared to React?
- What happens if certain React features cannot be directly translated to Vue patterns?
- How does the system handle deployment cutover from React to Vue frontend?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Vue frontend MUST implement authentication and navigation components first to establish user access foundation
- **FR-001a**: Vue frontend MUST display all existing pages (TestRuns, Host, Filters, UserManager) with identical functionality
- **FR-002**: Vue frontend MUST render all chart types (radar, line, 3D bar) with equivalent functionality, visual appearance may differ from React
- **FR-003**: Vue frontend MUST implement identical filtering and data selection capabilities
- **FR-004**: Vue frontend MUST support the same authentication and authorization flows
- **FR-005**: Vue frontend MUST provide identical export functionality for data and visualizations
- **FR-006**: Vue frontend MUST maintain the same responsive design and CSS styling
- **FR-007**: Vue frontend MUST support all pagination and data navigation features
- **FR-008**: Vue frontend MUST handle the same API endpoints and data structures with minimal frontend validation, relying on backend API validation
- **FR-009**: Vue frontend MUST preserve all user interface interactions and workflows
- **FR-010**: Vue frontend MUST maintain user interaction responsiveness comparable to React version, measured by click-to-render delays

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Runs**: Performance benchmark results with metrics like IOPS, latency, bandwidth
- **Host Configurations**: System specifications and test parameters for different hosts
- **Chart Data**: Formatted data structures for various visualization types
- **User Sessions**: Authentication state and user permissions for admin/upload roles
- **Filter States**: Active filter selections and data subset configurations
- **Export Formats**: Different output formats for data extraction and reporting
