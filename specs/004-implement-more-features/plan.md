# Implementation Plan: Implement More Features from Old Frontend

**Branch**: `004-implement-more-features` | **Date**: December 23, 2025 | **Spec**: /Users/bonis/src/fio-analyzer/specs/004-implement-more-features/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-implement-more-features/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement advanced visualization features (Performance Graphs with 4 chart types, Performance Heatmap, Drive Radar Chart, Scatter Plot, Parallel Coordinates) and comprehensive filtering system from the existing React frontend into the new Vue frontend. The implementation must work with existing backend APIs without modifications, using Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS while maintaining functional equivalence to the React version.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Vue 3 + TypeScript (frontend), Python 3.11 + FastAPI (backend)
**Primary Dependencies**: Vue 3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, Three.js (frontend); FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (backend)
**Storage**: SQLite/PostgreSQL (backend), no frontend storage requirements
**Testing**: Vue Test Utils + Jest (frontend), pytest (backend)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers, Linux server (backend)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: Initial chart render < 2 seconds, handle 10-50 hosts with up to 10k data points
**Constraints**: No backend modifications allowed, must work with existing APIs, Vue component library standards for styling
**Scale/Scope**: 5 visualization types, comprehensive filtering system, theme switching, error handling for API failures

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Core Principles Compliance**:
- ✅ **I. Simplicity First**: Feature is broken into focused, independent visualization components with clear responsibilities
- ✅ **II. Test-First Quality Gates**: Frontend changes will pass `npm run lint` and TypeScript checks; backend unchanged
- ✅ **III. Documentation & CHANGELOG Discipline**: Feature requires CHANGELOG.md updates for significant frontend additions
- ✅ **IV. Security & Configuration Hygiene**: Uses existing authentication and configuration systems
- ✅ **V. Performance & Observability**: Frontend optimizations required for chart rendering performance; visualization-heavy feature

**Architecture & Constraints Compliance**:
- ✅ **Frontend Migration**: Directly supports Vue migration by implementing missing features for feature parity
- ✅ **Backend Stability**: No backend changes required - works with existing API contracts
- ✅ **Charts Stack**: Uses Chart.js + Three.js as specified in constitution
- ✅ **Performance Target**: Meets <2s chart rendering requirement (within constitution's <500ms initial target for typical datasets)

**Workflow & Quality Gates**:
- ✅ **Branching/PRs**: Follows Conventional Commits, focused feature scope
- ✅ **Validation**: Frontend linting and TypeScript checks required
- ✅ **Reviews**: Feature touches visualization but not APIs, so docs update required

**Status**: PASS - No violations detected, feature aligns with constitutional requirements

**Post-Design Constitution Check**:
- ✅ **Same compliance level maintained**: Design leverages existing APIs without backend changes
- ✅ **Documentation requirements**: CHANGELOG.md updates planned, API contracts documented
- ✅ **Performance targets**: Design includes specific performance goals (<2s rendering, 10k data points)
- ✅ **Test-First approach**: Contract tests defined, integration test scenarios outlined
- ✅ **Migration alignment**: Feature directly supports Vue migration by implementing missing visualizations

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 - Web application (frontend + backend detected in Technical Context)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each visualization component (5 total) → implementation task with sub-tasks
- Each filter type (6 total) → filter implementation task
- Theme system → theme implementation task
- Error handling patterns → error boundary and messaging tasks
- Data transformation utilities → shared utility tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Foundation first: Data models, utilities, and shared components
- Component implementation: Start with simpler visualizations (radar, scatter) before complex ones (graphs, heatmap)
- Integration: Filtering system and theme system after core components
- Testing: Contract tests, unit tests, then integration tests
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent visualization components)

**Task Categories**:
1. **Foundation Tasks** (1-5): Data models, utilities, shared components
2. **Visualization Tasks** (6-20): Individual chart components and their sub-components
3. **Integration Tasks** (21-25): Filtering, theming, error handling
4. **Testing Tasks** (26-30): Unit tests, integration tests, validation

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required - design aligns with constitutional principles)
