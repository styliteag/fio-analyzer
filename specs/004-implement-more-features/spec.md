# Feature Specification: Implement More Features from Old Frontend

**Feature Branch**: `004-implement-more-features`
**Created**: December 23, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement more features from the old frontend. The old frontend is running at http://localhost:5173/ the new one at http://localhost:5175/ you the backend is also running. If you want the logs of the servers you can start them in background and look at the logs. But if you dont need just levae them running, they are autoupdating if you change something (vite and uv ...) There is so much missing in the new frontend. You can user mcp browser-tools to look at both. Pleae make the new frontend to have the same func as the old one, you dont have to copy all visulations But copy the \"Performance Graphs\" and \"Performance Heatmap\" from Hosts.tsx. Also make sure that we have the the same Filters as in the old Frontend. Implement also a dark/light mode Switch"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí User wants to implement missing features from old React frontend to new Vue frontend
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Performance Graphs component (4 chart types: IOPS, Latency, Bandwidth, Responsiveness)
   ‚Üí Performance Heatmap component (multi-dimensional visualization)
   ‚Üí Host filters (block sizes, patterns, queue depths, jobs, protocols, host-disk combinations)
   ‚Üí Dark/light mode theme toggle
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we copy ALL visualizations or only the specified ones? User said "you dont have to copy all visulations"]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we maintain exact same styling or adapt to Vue component library?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Multiple user interaction scenarios for each component
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (data structures needed)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-23
- Q: Which additional visualizations from the old frontend should be included? ‚Üí A: Include core visualizations (radar, scatter, parallel coordinates) plus the specified ones
- Q: What are the expected data volume and performance requirements? ‚Üí A: Medium datasets (10-50 hosts, < 10000 data points) with < 2 second chart rendering
- Q: Should the new Vue implementation maintain exact visual styling from the old React frontend or adapt to Vue component library standards? ‚Üí A: Adapt styling to Vue component library (e.g., Tailwind/Vue design system) while preserving functionality
- Q: What accessibility requirements should be met (WCAG compliance level, specific features needed)? ‚Üí A: No specific accessibility requirements beyond standard Vue component library features
- Q: What level of error handling and edge case coverage is required beyond basic empty states? ‚Üí A: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages for all API failures, invalid data, and network issues
- Q: Are backend API modifications or data structure changes allowed for this feature? ‚Üí A: No backend changes allowed - must work with existing APIs and data structures

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a storage performance analyst, I want to access advanced visualization features from the old frontend (Performance Graphs and Performance Heatmap) in the new Vue application, along with comprehensive filtering capabilities and dark/light mode theming, so that I can maintain the same level of analysis functionality while benefiting from the improved architecture.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the Host analysis page, **When** they select the "graphs" visualization view, **Then** they should see interactive performance graphs with chart type selection (IOPS Comparison, Latency Analysis, Bandwidth Trends, Responsiveness)
2. **Given** a user is on the Host analysis page, **When** they select the "heatmap" visualization view, **Then** they should see a multi-dimensional performance fingerprint heatmap showing IOPS, bandwidth, and responsiveness metrics across block sizes and patterns
3. **Given** a user is on the Host analysis page, **When** they select the "radar" visualization view, **Then** they should see a radar chart comparing multiple performance metrics across drives
4. **Given** a user is on the Host analysis page, **When** they select the "scatter" visualization view, **Then** they should see a scatter plot showing correlations between performance metrics
5. **Given** a user is on the Host analysis page, **When** they select the "parallel" visualization view, **Then** they should see a parallel coordinates chart for multi-attribute performance analysis
6. **Given** a user is analyzing host performance data, **When** they apply filters for block sizes, patterns, queue depths, number of jobs, protocols, or host-disk combinations, **Then** the visualizations should update to show only filtered data
7. **Given** a user wants to change the application theme, **When** they click the theme toggle, **Then** they should be able to select between light mode, dark mode, or system preference
8. **Given** a user has applied filters, **When** they switch between different visualization views, **Then** the same filters should remain active and applied to the new view

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no performance data is available for selected hosts?
- How does the system handle very large datasets in the heatmap visualization?
- What happens when filter combinations result in no matching data?
- How does theme switching affect existing chart colors and styling?
- What happens when the system theme changes while user has "system" theme selected?
- What happens when API requests timeout or fail with network errors?
- How does the system handle malformed or invalid data from the backend?
- What happens when only partial data loads successfully?
- How does the system handle concurrent API requests and potential race conditions?
- What happens when chart rendering fails due to unsupported data formats?
