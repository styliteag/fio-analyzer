# Tasks: Implement More Features from Old Frontend

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-implement-more-features/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Vue 3 + TypeScript, Chart.js, Tailwind CSS
   → Structure: frontend-vue/ with components/, composables/, pages/
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → data model and utility tasks
   → contracts/: API contract validation tasks
   → research.md: Extract technical decisions → implementation patterns
   → quickstart.md: Extract validation scenarios → integration tests
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Vue project structure, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: API contract tests, integration tests for acceptance scenarios
   → Core: Data models, visualization components, filtering, theming
   → Integration: API integration, component communication, error handling
   → Polish: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All acceptance scenarios have integration tests?
   → All data entities have implementation?
   → All visualization components implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

Task: "IOPSComparisonChart component in frontend-vue/src/components/PerformanceGraphs/components/IOPSComparisonChart.vue"
Task: "LatencyAnalysisChart component in frontend-vue/src/components/PerformanceGraphs/components/LatencyAnalysisChart.vue"
Task: "BandwidthTrendsChart component in frontend-vue/src/components/PerformanceGraphs/components/BandwidthTrendsChart.vue"

# Launch T041-T044 together (Unit test tasks):
Task: "Unit tests for data transformation utilities in frontend-vue/src/utils/__tests__/dataTransform.spec.ts"
Task: "Unit tests for chart processing utilities in frontend-vue/src/utils/__tests__/chartProcessing.spec.ts"
Task: "Unit tests for filter composables in frontend-vue/src/composables/__tests__/useFilters.spec.ts"
Task: "Unit tests for theme composables in frontend-vue/src/composables/__tests__/useTheme.spec.ts"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, can run in parallel
- Verify tests fail before implementing any functionality
- Commit after each completed task
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns throughout
- Maintain functional equivalence with React implementation
- No backend changes allowed - work with existing APIs

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - test-runs-api.yaml → API contract test task [P]
   - test-runs-api.test.js → API validation test task [P]

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity (PerformanceData, FilterState, etc.) → interface/model task [P]
   - Each utility function → utility implementation task [P]

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each acceptance scenario → integration test task [P]
   - Quickstart validation steps → validation tasks

4. **From Research**:
   - Technical recommendations → implementation pattern tasks
   - Performance optimizations → optimization tasks

5. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Data Models → Components → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution where files overlap

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (API validation tests created)
- [x] All entities have model/interface tasks (5 data entities covered)
- [x] All visualization types have implementation tasks (5 chart types covered)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios have integration tests (6 integration tests created)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (TDD order maintained)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different file paths)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path (all tasks have specific paths)
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task (parallel tasks use different files)
