# Implementation Plan: Rewrite Frontend to Vue.js

**Branch**: `001-rewrite-the-frontend` | **Date**: 2025-09-23 | **Spec**: /Users/bonis/src/fio-analyzer/specs/001-rewrite-the-frontend/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-rewrite-the-frontend/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 9. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Rewrite the existing React frontend to a Vue 3 application with full feature parity. Maintain API contracts and keep the backend unchanged. Use Chart.js via vue-chartjs for 2D charts (including radar) and Three.js for 3D. Include fullscreen chart UX. Allow broader UX improvements with explicit approval. Target <500ms initial chart render for typical datasets. Build the new app in `frontend-vue/` and decommission `frontend/` after parity.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Vue 3 (Composition API), TypeScript; Node for tooling
**Primary Dependencies**: vue, vue-router, pinia (state management), chart.js, vue-chartjs, three
**Storage**: N/A (frontend only)
**Testing**: ESLint + TypeScript checks; unit tests (vitest/jest TBD)
**Target Platform**: Web (nginx-served SPA via Docker)
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend; backend untouched)
**Performance Goals**: Initial chart render < 500ms typical dataset; smooth interaction
**Constraints**: Backend API unchanged; `VITE_API_URL` build-time config; security/auth unchanged
**Scale/Scope**: All existing pages/features migrated; charts for potentially heavy datasets

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Simplicity First: Plan favors minimal, scoped changes per page; new dir `frontend-vue/` enables gradual migration and rollback. PASS
- Test-First Quality Gates: Lint and type checks required; add minimal tests for critical flows. PASS
- Documentation & CHANGELOG Discipline: Will update README and CHANGELOG under [Unreleased]. PASS
- Security & Configuration Hygiene: No secrets committed; respect `VITE_API_URL` and roles. PASS
- Performance & Observability: Maintain perf budget; preserve logging/metrics where applicable. PASS

**Structure Decision**: Web application. New `frontend-vue/` alongside existing `frontend/` for safe migration.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Chart.js + vue-chartjs integration nuances; Three.js scene management
   - Routing, state management approach (vue-router, pinia usage)
   - Build config with Vite and `VITE_API_URL` parity
   - Performance optimization patterns for Vue 3 Composition API

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Best practices for large datasets with Chart.js in Vue
   - Three.js integration patterns for dashboard components
   - Vue router structure mirroring current pages
   - Radar chart implementation with Chart.js/vue-chartjs for optimal performance

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entities: Test Run, Performance Data Series, User (roles)
   - Map UI views to API endpoints; document props/state per view
   - Chart data structures and transformations

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - No backend changes; list consumed endpoints for each view
   - Confirm request/response schemas used in UI
   - Chart data contracts for radar, 3D, and time-series visualizations

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - N/A for backend; capture UI contract mapping and validation checklist
   - Performance benchmarks for chart rendering

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Define quickstart steps to validate parity
   - Include radar chart render validation and performance checks

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
   - Add Vue 3 + TypeScript tech references to agent context

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file (if updated)

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Pages first: scaffold, routing, auth, data services
- Charts implementation: 2D (including radar), 3D, interactions
- UI components: filters, selectors, modals, responsive layouts

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)
- Prioritize radar chart implementation for FR-003 compliance

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No deviations from constitution identified.*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
