# Feature Specification: Rewrite Frontend to Vue.js

**Feature Branch**: `001-rewrite-the-frontend`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Rewrite the Frontend to use Vue.js, remove React components, transfer all features. Decide whether to create a new directory or reuse current frontend/."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: Are backend changes allowed as part of this migration? ‚Üí A: Backend must not be touched.
- Q: Which Vue version should we target? ‚Üí A: Vue 3
- Q: Preferred charting approach? ‚Üí A: Chart.js (vue-chartjs) for 2D + Three.js for 3D
- Q: UI parity vs improvements? ‚Üí A: Allow broader UX improvements with approval
 - Q: Performance target for typical datasets? ‚Üí A: < 500ms initial chart render
 - Q: Directory name for Vue app? ‚Üí A: frontend-vue

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an authenticated user (admin or uploader), I can access the application via a Vue.js-based frontend with the same functionality and user experience parity as the current React app, including authentication, uploads, browsing and filtering test runs, time-series visualizations, performance comparisons, and admin management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is deployed with the Vue.js frontend, **When** an admin signs in, **Then** they can perform all existing actions (upload, manage users, edit/delete test runs, view charts) with responsive UI and no feature regressions.
2. **Given** a user opens any page supported in the React app, **When** they navigate and interact with controls, **Then** the page renders, filters, and exports data as expected with performance comparable to or better than the current app.

### Edge Cases
- Lost or slow network: The UI displays clear loading/cancellation states; API request cancellation prevents stale updates.
- Large datasets: Charts render without freezing; pagination/virtualization preserves responsiveness.
- Auth errors: Invalid credentials display appropriate errors without browser auth popups.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide all current frontend features on Vue.js with parity to React implementation (pages: Home, Performance, Compare, History, Host, Upload, Admin, UserManager).
- **FR-002**: System MUST support authentication flows (admin and uploader roles) and respect role-based access for all UI actions.
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement all visualization features (charts, time-series, radar, 3D bar) with equivalent interactions: filtering, grouping, sorting, zooming, exporting (PNG/CSV), fullscreen, and series toggles.
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve API integration semantics, including `VITE_API_URL` behavior and endpoints documented in Swagger.
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain performance optimizations (request cancellation, memoization-equivalent patterns) to keep interactions smooth under typical data volumes.
- **FR-006**: System MUST support uploading FIO JSON files with metadata collection and error handling.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide admin functions: manage users, edit/bulk edit/delete test runs, and time-series ops where applicable.
- **FR-008**: System MUST include responsive design and accessibility equivalence.
- **FR-009**: System MUST pass lint and type checks for the chosen Vue stack and integrate with existing build/deploy pipelines (including Docker/nginx paths).
- **FR-010**: System MUST update documentation reflecting the new frontend while keeping API unchanged.
- **FR-015**: Migration Directory Strategy: Create a new directory `frontend-vue/` for the Vue implementation to allow parallel development and zero downtime; decommission `frontend/` after full parity and switch-over. Rationale: enables side-by-side validation, simpler rollback, and minimizes risk.
- **FR-016**: Backend MUST NOT be modified by this migration; API contracts and endpoints remain unchanged.
- **FR-017**: Charts stack: Use Chart.js with vue-chartjs for 2D charts and Three.js for 3D visualizations to achieve feature parity and performance.
- **FR-018**: UX improvements beyond pixel parity are allowed but MUST be explicitly approved during review, with rationale and no loss of functionality.
 - **FR-019**: Performance: Initial chart render for typical datasets MUST be under 500ms.
 - **FR-020**: Directory: Implement the Vue app in `frontend-vue/`; decommission `frontend/` after full parity and switchover.

*Ambiguities to clarify:*
- **FR-011**: Use Vue 3 (Composition API) for the frontend implementation. (RESOLVED)
- **FR-012**: Chart stack chosen: Chart.js + vue-chartjs (2D) and Three.js (3D). (RESOLVED)
- **FR-013**: UX approach: broader improvements allowed with approval. (RESOLVED)
 - **FR-014**: Performance target: initial chart render < 500ms. (RESOLVED)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Run**: Metadata and performance metrics used to render charts, filter, and edit.
- **Performance Data Series**: Time-series and radar/3D datasets sourced from API endpoints.
- **User**: Authentication and authorization context (admin/uploader) affecting UI capabilities.
