## [0.5.8] - 2025-09-14

### Added
- 

## [0.5.7] - 2025-09-14

### Fixed
- Authentication API calls from nested routes (e.g., /host/redshark) by using absolute paths instead of relative paths
- Latency values of 0.00ms were not displaying in Performance Fingerprint Heatmap hover tooltips due to incorrect null coalescing
- Multi-host filtering issues when selecting 2+ hosts - key mismatch between filter logic and heatmap processing
- Performance Fingerprint Heatmap dark mode styling issues with borders, backgrounds, and bar colors
- ESLint warning about unused variable in hostAnalysis.ts

### Added
- Comprehensive VITE_API_URL documentation in AGENTS.md
- Performance Fingerprint Heatmap visualization with comprehensive data analysis features
- Mini bar graphs in Performance Fingerprint Heatmap cells showing three metrics: IOPS (blue), Bandwidth (green), Responsiveness (1000/Latency, red)
- Each bar displays normalized performance percentage relative to the host/drive maximum
- Updated legend with metric color coding and improved layout
- Enhanced cell tooltips with detailed multi-dimensional performance data
- IOPS numbers prominently displayed at the top of each heatmap cell with clear labeling
- Responsiveness values shown in tooltips with "ops/ms" units and calculation explanation
- User-friendly explanation of how Responsiveness is calculated (1000 รท Latency)

### Enhanced
- Performance Fingerprint Heatmap cell display: larger IOPS numbers with "IOPS:" label, removed redundant debug text for cleaner appearance
- Performance Fingerprint Heatmap tooltips now display latency in nanoseconds instead of milliseconds for better precision
- Performance Fingerprint Heatmap includes detailed Responsiveness calculation explanation and actual values
- Reordered visualization controls: Performance Heatmap now appears second after Overview for better user experience
- Performance Fingerprint Heatmap bars now normalize against visible/filtered data for fair comparison within current view
