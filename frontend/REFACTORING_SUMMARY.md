# TestRunSelector Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the large TestRunSelector component (614 lines) into a modular architecture with focused, reusable components and custom hooks.

## New Architecture

### Custom Hooks
1. **`hooks/useTestRunFilters.ts`** - Manages filter state and logic
   - Handles active filters state
   - Provides filtered test runs based on criteria
   - Includes utility functions for checking/clearing filters

2. **`hooks/useTestRunSelection.ts`** - Manages selection state and logic
   - Handles test run selection/deselection
   - Provides formatted options for react-select
   - Manages "select all matching" functionality

3. **`hooks/useTestRunOperations.ts`** - Manages CRUD operations
   - Handles edit/delete operations for individual test runs
   - Manages bulk operations (edit/delete)
   - Provides modal state management

### Components
1. **`components/testRuns/TestRunFilters.tsx`** - Filter controls
   - Drive types, models, patterns, block sizes, hostnames, protocols
   - Uses react-select with proper theme styling
   - Responsive grid layout

2. **`components/testRuns/TestRunGrid.tsx`** - Selected test runs display
   - Responsive grid layout for test run cards
   - Hover actions for edit/delete
   - Optimized for mobile and desktop

3. **`components/testRuns/TestRunActions.tsx`** - Action buttons
   - Bulk edit/delete actions
   - "Add all matching" functionality
   - Conditional rendering based on selection state

4. **`components/testRuns/TestRunSelector.tsx`** - Main orchestrator
   - Composes all smaller components
   - Handles data fetching and error states
   - Maintains the same API interface for backward compatibility

### Legacy Integration
- **`components/TestRunSelector.tsx`** now re-exports the new modular version
- Maintains complete backward compatibility
- All existing imports continue to work

## Benefits of Refactoring

### Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Reusability**: Components can be used independently
- **Testability**: Smaller components are easier to test
- **Maintainability**: Changes are localized to specific components

### Performance
- **Optimized Rendering**: Smaller components reduce unnecessary re-renders
- **Better Memoization**: Custom hooks enable targeted performance optimizations
- **Efficient State Management**: State is only updated where needed

### Developer Experience
- **TypeScript Support**: Proper type definitions for all components
- **Consistent API**: Follows existing patterns in the codebase
- **Error Handling**: Improved error states and loading indicators
- **Theme Integration**: Proper theme support throughout

## File Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── TestRunSelector.tsx (legacy re-export)
│   └── testRuns/
│       ├── TestRunFilters.tsx
│       ├── TestRunGrid.tsx
│       ├── TestRunActions.tsx
│       └── TestRunSelector.tsx
└── hooks/
    ├── useTestRunFilters.ts
    ├── useTestRunSelection.ts
    └── useTestRunOperations.ts
```

## API Compatibility
The refactored component maintains the exact same props interface:
```typescript
interface TestRunSelectorProps {
    selectedRuns: TestRun[];
    onSelectionChange: (runs: TestRun[]) => void;
    refreshTrigger?: number;
}
```

## Key Features Preserved
- All filtering capabilities (drive types, models, patterns, etc.)
- Test run selection with react-select
- Bulk operations (edit/delete)
- Individual test run actions
- Responsive grid layout
- Theme integration
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Modal management

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test each component in isolation
2. Verify hook functionality with different state combinations
3. Ensure backward compatibility with existing usage
4. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
5. Validate theme integration in light/dark modes

## Future Improvements
- Add unit tests for each component and hook
- Consider adding prop validation with PropTypes
- Add Storybook stories for component documentation
- Implement performance monitoring
- Add accessibility improvements

## Migration Notes
- No breaking changes - existing code continues to work
- All imports remain the same
- All functionality is preserved
- New modular components can be imported individually if needed
