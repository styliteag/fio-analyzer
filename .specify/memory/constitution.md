**Project Name**: FIO Analyzer - Storage Performance Visualizer
**Constitution Version**: 1.0.0
**Ratification Date**: 2025-09-22
**Last Amended Date**: 2025-09-22

## Purpose and Scope

FIO Analyzer is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to analyze and visualize FIO (Flexible I/O Tester) benchmark results. This constitution establishes the foundational principles and governance framework for developing, maintaining, and operating this storage performance analysis platform.

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Performance-First Development
**Name**: Performance-First Development
**Rule**: All code changes MUST be evaluated for performance impact on both frontend rendering and backend processing. Performance regressions are considered blocking issues that require immediate resolution.

**Rationale**: Given that FIO Analyzer processes large datasets of storage performance metrics and renders complex interactive visualizations, maintaining optimal performance is critical for user experience and system scalability.

### Principle 2: API-First Architecture
**Name**: API-First Architecture
**Rule**: All new features MUST be developed API-first, with comprehensive OpenAPI documentation generated automatically. API contracts MUST remain stable and backward-compatible.

**Rationale**: The FastAPI backend serves multiple consumers including the React frontend, automated testing scripts, and potential third-party integrations. API-first development ensures consistency and maintainability.

### Principle 3: Type Safety and Data Integrity
**Name**: Type Safety and Data Integrity
**Rule**: All TypeScript code MUST maintain strict type safety with zero 'any' types. All database operations MUST include proper validation using Pydantic models. Performance metrics data MUST be validated for accuracy and completeness.

**Rationale**: Storage performance data is critical for infrastructure decisions. Type safety and validation prevent data corruption and ensure reliable analysis results.

### Principle 4: Authentication and Security
**Name**: Authentication and Security
**Rule**: All API endpoints MUST require authentication. User credentials MUST be stored securely using bcrypt hashing. Role-based access control MUST be enforced between admin and upload-only users.

**Rationale**: Performance data often contains sensitive infrastructure information. Proper authentication prevents unauthorized access and maintains data confidentiality.

### Principle 5: Test Coverage and Quality Assurance
**Name**: Test Coverage and Quality Assurance
**Rule**: All frontend code changes MUST pass ESLint validation and TypeScript compilation checks. All new features MUST include appropriate test coverage. Database migrations MUST be thoroughly tested.

**Rationale**: The application handles critical performance data used for infrastructure decisions. Code quality and testing prevent bugs that could lead to incorrect performance analysis.

### Principle 6: Documentation and Observability
**Name**: Documentation and Observability
**Rule**: All API changes MUST be documented in the auto-generated OpenAPI specification. All significant code changes MUST be documented in CHANGELOG.md. Performance metrics and system health MUST be observable through logging and monitoring.

**Rationale**: Comprehensive documentation ensures maintainability and enables effective troubleshooting. Observability is essential for monitoring system health and performance.

### Principle 7: Containerization and Deployment
**Name**: Containerization and Deployment
**Rule**: The application MUST be deployable as a single Docker container for production use. Development setup MUST support both containerized and native environments. All deployment configurations MUST be version-controlled.

**Rationale**: Consistent deployment reduces operational complexity and ensures reproducible environments across development, testing, and production.

## Governance

### Amendment Process
1. **Proposal**: Amendments may be proposed via pull request with detailed rationale
2. **Review**: Changes require review by project maintainers
3. **Approval**: Major amendments require consensus among active contributors
4. **Documentation**: All amendments must update this constitution and increment version

### Version Management
- **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible principle changes or removals
- **MINOR**: New principles added or material expansions to existing principles
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, or non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review
- Constitution compliance MUST be reviewed during all pull requests
- Principle violations MUST be addressed before code merge
- Regular architecture reviews MUST assess ongoing alignment with constitutional principles

### Enforcement
- Pull request reviews MUST verify adherence to constitutional principles
- Continuous integration MUST enforce technical principles (linting, type checking, testing)
- Security principles MUST be validated through code review and testing
