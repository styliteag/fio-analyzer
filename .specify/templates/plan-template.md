# Implementation Plan Template

## Execution Flow (main)

This template provides a structured approach to generating implementation artifacts for features. Follow these phases in order:

### Phase 0: Research and Analysis
1. Analyze the feature specification to understand requirements
2. Research existing codebase patterns and architecture
3. Identify dependencies and integration points
4. Generate research.md with findings and architectural decisions

### Phase 1: Data and Contracts
1. Define data models and types required for the feature
2. Create API contracts and interfaces
3. Generate data-model.md with type definitions
4. Create contracts/ directory with interface specifications
5. Generate quickstart.md with setup and usage instructions

### Phase 2: Task Breakdown
1. Break down implementation into specific, actionable tasks
2. Define task dependencies and execution order
3. Generate tasks.md with detailed task specifications
4. Include testing and validation tasks

## Progress Tracking

- [ ] Phase 0: Research Complete
- [ ] Phase 1: Data Models Complete
- [ ] Phase 2: Task Breakdown Complete
- [ ] All artifacts generated
- [ ] Execution verified

## Error Handling

If any phase encounters errors:
1. Document the error in the progress tracking
2. Attempt resolution based on constitutional principles
3. If unresolvable, mark as ERROR state and proceed to next phase
4. Report all errors in final execution summary

## Gate Checks

Each phase must pass these checks before proceeding:
- Constitutional compliance verified
- All required artifacts generated
- No blocking errors encountered
- Progress tracking updated

## Artifact Generation

All artifacts should be generated in the specified SPECS_DIR with proper naming conventions and include:
- Clear objectives and requirements
- Technical implementation details
- Testing and validation criteria
- Constitutional compliance verification
